    <h2 class="motw"><i>Monster of the Week</i>: there are monsters out there.</h2>
    <p>Most people don't believe in them, but they're real. Mostly, when someone finds out 
    that monsters are real, that's just before they die.</p>
    <p>But some people are mean enough, smart enough, crazy enough, or hurt enough, that 
    they live. And some of those people go and hunt down more.</p>
    <p>That's who you are â€“ someone who decided to go on a crusade against the evil 
    critters that are scurrying around out there.</p>
    <p>It could be that you make a stand and defend your hometown from everything evil 
    that comes there.</p>
    <p>It could be you take to the road and go find them.</p>
    <p>It could be you have magic powers that help out.</p>
    <p>It could be that your name came up in prophecies thousands of years ago.</p>
    <p><strong>The one sure thing is you aren't gonna go back to your old, safe life.</strong><p>
